"""Input-familiarity checks shared by the Streamlit app, the notebook and the tests.

A number can be a *valid* input (finite, pH between 0 and 14, humidity between 0 and 100)
and still be an *unreliable* input, because the model only learned from rows that fall
inside a limited region of feature space.  Two kinds of check are made:

1. Per-feature range check  - is each value inside the range seen when the model was fitted?
2. Combination check        - even if every value is individually in range, is the combination
                              close to at least one fitted row?  (nearest-neighbour distance in
                              standardised feature space, calibrated on the fitted rows themselves)

The thresholds are stored in model_metadata.json by the notebook, so they always describe the
same rows that the saved model was fitted on.
